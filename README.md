I just made a script on javascript that creates a private key given a specified range

i.e. from 0 to 1000, and it creates an empty 32-bit string that is filled with zeros.

Then, it generates the public key of the respective private keys and checks for its balance on the blockchain.

I got hundreds of account with transactions like that, ranging from 0.0001 BTC up to 0.4 BTC in the early beginnings of Bitcoin and I was able to import those WIF private key accounts into Electron Cash and get a look at the transactions list.

I get the wallets in the following format:
Private Key (WIF): KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH7LrciVrZi3qYjgd9M7rFUW5RtS2JN1

Public Key: 038b00fcbfc1a203f44bf123fc7f4c91c10a85c8eae9187f9d22242b4600ce781c

Bitcoin Address: 1DBaumZxUkM4qMQRt2LVWyFJq5kDtSZQot

Number of transactions: 4

Total received (in satoshis): 1200961

Total sent (in satoshis): 1200961

Final balance (in satoshis): 0


you can specify wallet range in the for loop

requirements:


路yarn

路nodejs


To launch the script run:


路yarn install

路node index.js




unfortunately, though, it seems that other developers have looked into this so up until now I wasn't able to find any with a balance, but the transaction lists that span from the beginning of bitcoin's popularization are cool though and the private keys of those accounts, i.e. all 666666 that has a transfer with the amount of 666 or a priv key that has 1111 numbers with 1234 satoshi transfered in it
